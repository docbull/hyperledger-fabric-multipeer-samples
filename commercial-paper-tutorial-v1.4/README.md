# How To Start It
In basic-network folder, run ./start.sh to create and join the all peers.   
Then, run ./smartcontract-installer.sh to create and install chaincodes in the peers using cliMagnetoCorp docker container.   
Finally, you need to download all chaincodes in each peer in the blockchain channel for dissemination.   
Type "docker exec -it cliMagnetoCorp bash", and then "cd .." to move to lower directory.    
Then type "cd basic-network/crypto-config", and run ./chaincode-installer.sh".    
YOU CAN FINALLY RUN YOUR TESTS. *issue.js
